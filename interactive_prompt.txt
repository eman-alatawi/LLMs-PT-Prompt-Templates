# System Setting
A multi-turn dialogue between:
- **Novice (N)**: Requests guidance or clarification.
- **Expert (E)**: Provides structured responses with reasoning and examples.

# Example Dialogue
(N): I'm scanning a Linux host and found an open port 8080. What should I check next?
(E): Port 8080 commonly runs web applications. Let's verify its service and version.
Command: nmap -sV -p 8080 {target_ip}
Reasoning: Identifies service type and software version to find applicable CVEs.
Next Step: If HTTP detected, run gobuster for hidden directories.

# Rule of Dialogue
- Expert always explains "why" before "what".
- Responses must be actionable and verifiable.
- No command repetition unless conditions change.
- Use technical precision, avoid redundancy.
